TeamUp is a React web application for team management. Users have a customizable profile where they can add skills that they believe they have. Users are then able to create teams or join teams. When creating a team, one can set skills that they are looking for in new members. When joining, one can search teams by size, desired skills, or general topic. Teams can be open or require an invite/application. There is also a team chat and, if all members input their schedules, they are given a list of what time-blocks everyone is free. I was responsible for all server code and database management (NodeJS + MongoDB) and some frontend routing.

Hi! I'm a 23 year old software engineer living in downtown Chicago. I graduated from Purdue last Spring with bachelor's degrees in both Computer Science and Psychology. I went into CS because I've loved video games my whole life (still my favorite hobby) and I wanted to learn how I could make them myself. When I'm not coding or playing games, I'm usually playing guitar, reading mystery novels, or listening to one of my game soundtrack vinyls. Thanks for taking the time to look at my previous work. Cheers!

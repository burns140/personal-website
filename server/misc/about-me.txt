Hi! I'm a 24 year old software engineer living in Colorado Springs. I graduated from Purdue in the spring of 2020 with bachelor's degrees in both Computer Science and Psychology. I went into CS because I've loved games my whole life and I wanted to learn how I could make them myself. Not in the industry yet, but hopefully I will be one day. When I'm not coding or playing games, I'm usually playing guitar, reading mystery novels, or listening to one of my game soundtrack vinyls. Thanks for taking the time to look at my previous work. Cheers!

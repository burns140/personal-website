Eldritch Duels is an Eldritch Themed TCG. Each user account has a card collection and user-created decks, as well as past gameplay stats, achievements, and a friends list. Users were also able to customize their profile. Players could play in casual, ranked, or private matches and compare themselves to other players on the leaderboards. I was responsible for the networking code (written in C# and NodeJS) and database management/data processing (NodeJS and MongoDB).
